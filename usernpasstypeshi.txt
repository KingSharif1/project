Certainly! Since you're setting up a **TransportHub** portal, it's helpful to have a mix of facility types (Hospitals, Nursing Homes, and Dialysis Centers) to test how your billing tiers and service levels (Ambulatory, Wheelchair, Stretcher) function.

Here are three distinct profiles you can use for testing:

### 1. The High-Volume Hospital

**Best for:** Testing multiple billing tiers and high-mileage additional rates.

* **Contractor Name:** Riverview Regional Medical Center
* **Address:** 1200 Healthcare Plaza, Springfield, IL 62704
* **Phone:** 555-0122 | **Contact:** Sarah Jenkins (Discharge Coordinator)
* **Billing Strategy:**
* **Ambulatory:** $30 (0–5 miles), $50 (5–15 miles), $2.50/mile after.
* **Wheelchair:** $55 (0–5 miles), $85 (5–15 miles), $3.75/mile after.
* **Stretcher:** $150 flat + $5.00/mile.


* **Cancellation/No-Show:** $25.00

---

### 2. The Local Nursing Home

**Best for:** Testing flat rates or very short-distance "community" pricing.

### 3. The Specialized Clinic (Dialysis)

**Best for:** Testing recurring logic (if applicable) and standard wheelchair transport.

* **Contractor Name:** ClearStream Dialysis Center
* **Address:** 888 Medical Center Dr, Suite 4, Springfield, IL 62703
* **Phone:** 555-0155 | **Contact:** Reception Desk

* **Ambulatory:** $20 base + $1.50/mile.
* **Wheelchair:** $40 base + $2.50/mile.
* **Stretcher:** N/A (or $200 high-entry rate to discourage use).


* **Cancellation/No-Show:** $50.00 (Strict policy for missed chairs).

To help you test the **TransportHub Management Portal**, I’ve put together three distinct testing scenarios. These will help you verify that different trip classifications, service levels, and billing accounts are processing correctly.

### Scenario 1: Standard Medical Appointment (Ambulatory)

### Pro-Tips for Testing:

* **Mileage Calculation:** Once you enter the addresses, be sure to click the **[Calculate Mileage]** button to see if the Google Maps integration (if active) populates the miles automatically.
* **Smart Auto-Assign:** After creating these, you can try the **[Smart Auto-Assign]** button on the main list to see if the system matches these trips to your available drivers.
